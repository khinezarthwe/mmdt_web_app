## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- **Python**: If you don't have Python installed, follow this [guide](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-python/) to install it.
- **Git**: If you don't have Git installed, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Project Setup

Let's set up the project step by step:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the project files by running this command: `git clone <repository_url>`

2. **Open the Project**: Use your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to open the project folder.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Recommended): It's a good practice to isolate project dependencies. You can create a virtual environment by following [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

4. **Install Project Dependencies**: Run the command `pip install -r requirement.txt` to install the necessary libraries.
   - create .env in file under mmdt-web-app/mmdt/.env and add the following key:value pair
    ```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'your AWS S3 key'
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = 'your AWS S3 secret key '
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'your S3 bucketname '
    DEBUG = True or False
    SECRET_KEY = 'xxxxx'
    ```
   

5. **Database Setup**:
   - Run these commands to set up the database:
     ```
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

6. **Create an Admin User**: Use this command `python manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin user for managing the application: You'll be prompted to enter a username, email, and password for the admin user.

7. **Run the Project**: Start the web application by running: `python manage.py runserver`

8. **Access the Application**:
You can now access the following URLs in your web browser:
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/): Home Page/Blog Page 
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin): Admin Panel
